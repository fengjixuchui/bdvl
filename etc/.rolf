Eddy!
I love canoes.
Canadians are weird.
I was a moose once.
Boing! It's a lightbulb! Boing!
AWAY WITH YOU, UNWANTED PESTERERS!
An elephant never forgets, Double D, but I forget what the elephant remembered.
An apple a day keeps the bus driver away, Double D!
Let's sing a song!
FASTER, PUSSYCAT, FASTER!
I am Ed! CHEESE AND MACARONI!
I found my sensitive side, and it has a rash.
Summer rains, you can never predict them.
Well, well, well, it seems one can't attend to their functions without being replaced by SOME RAGTAG HAND PUPPET!
Eddy, stop! Trees have feelings! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
I CAN'T BREATHE!
Eddy, need I remind you of Sarah's instability and lack of rational thought?
A pebble?! Ed's bad mood was all because he had a *pebble* in his *shoe*?!
And I'm Theodor Geisel.
Telephones aren't CURSED, Eddy! THEY'RE PLASTIC! Calm down, Double D. Think ocean waves, sea mammals, arias...
Well, I can see atrocious penmanship runs in the family.
Time's a-wastin! I've always wanted to say that.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
You know the drill. Cough up some dough then swing.
If you can't beat 'em... show off!
If you want to get noticed, you've got to mingle.
Ed! What do you have to say for yourself?!
What? And ruin the plot?
Oh, no, no, who else? I accept this award on behalf of myself!
Yup, Valentine's Day is just the same ol' grind for this chick magnet.
NOT KNITTING!!!!!
You guys have gotta trust us! How are we supposed to rip you off if you don't trust us?
Alright, Moo-Goo-Gai-Dork.
Moby Dork is mine!
Hello, Eddy!
Your garden is overgrown and your cucumbers are soft!
Do not burn the candle at both ends, as it leads to the life of a hairdresser.
May the fleas from your cow inflame your rhubarb!
Ed Boy...
May your nose fester with the rage of olives!
MY PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN LIKE MY MAMA'S HEAD OF HAIR!
THE BURDEN OF HOSPITALITY IS TOO GREAT FOR ROLF!
You have broken a celery stalk on the back of a sea urchin!
Hello, Ed Boys. Why must you spoil Wilfred with this lavish monkey suit? This will only lead him to search for a life as an airline steward.
Rolf respects your vow to uphold the sticky notes of elders, yet *puts on the Hat of Discipline* you must be punished.
Very impressive, Ed Boy. It is a shame you fail with such disgrace at your pitiful attempt to prove your sorry and feeble effort at becoming an Urban Ranger.
Ed Boys! Your mattress has ruptured Rolf's tail bone! Who is in charge of this double-crossing slumber flim-flammery?!
The stench of immortal doom still thickens the air, yes? Or, perhaps it is Wilfred's cabbage evacuations? Hard to tell.
The days of reckoning are upon us, half naked Ed boys, for it is here that we will be mercilessly judged
This alphabet F confounds Rolf to no end! Phooey! Rolf would not line Wilfred's plumbing pit with such dribble.
As it is said in your country, LET HER ROCK!
Begone! Cursed underlings of Valhalla!
Shed tears no more, fuss-bucket Nazz girl. Rolf will unearth the Ed Boys like the parasite that infects Wilfred's tuchus! This is Rolf's word! ...Dawg!
Wilfred! You interrupt Rolf's study! Do you think this is party time for 1999? NO!
EAT DOLLS!
Someone get me off this Merry-Go-Round called life!
Hey Marie, can you flip me over? I'm getting crispy.
He's my little pooky bear.
What number do you dial for 911?
